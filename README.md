# Spotify-popularity-ML
Using R I have created machine learning algorithms which attempt to predict if a Spotify song is going to be popular and what the genre of the song is going to be based on different attributes of the songs.  
This was a project which I originally completed during a course I took at the Katz Graduate School of Business at Pitt.
